Events Website

System architecture

I will build the project using the Full Stack MERN Application. I will be using Mongoose as my database to Store users and Event Displays. I will be using Node Js as my server and then using Express as my middleware application this will connect to mongoose as well as to the front end which I will be using React Native. I will attempt to deploy the app via Heroku as I have a little knowledge from some previous projects. My goal will be to deploy the project as one unit meaning I will need to structure the build that will allow for these specifications. My choice to use React Native as my front end is because of the versatility and I will be using the state function which is Reacts main feature. I also find it a lot more comfortable to write code with React as I donâ€™t need to create separate JavaScript and HTML files. The tools that I have used to style the app are a mixture of Bootstrap and CSS I enjoy using the Bootstrap as a starting point and the customizing the elements to my own needs for e.g. using a Card element but then adding customised items and different style effects like shadow box.

System requirements specification

The users of the events web app will be people who are interested in finding about details for events in Cape Town. Once registered to the site each User will be shown a list of different events. Admins of the site can Update Delete Post and Remove events.

Functional Requirements

The Web app must have User Authentication system where is Users either need to register an account or log into an existing account.

Each user needs to see the events displayed when he or she logs in.

Admins will need to have access to options to Delete, Edit ,Create and Update new events.

Non-Functional Requirements

The amount of time that it takes a user to log in should be no longer than half a second.

The events Displayed must have full functionality, tests must be run before

deploying the app to make sure there are no bugs etc.

The layout of web page must be eye catching and clear and concise.

The site should be protected from outside breaches.

The code needs to be well organised and sufficient so that the application will run smoothly at all times.


Running the APP. 

in order to run the app on your machine and use the project you will need to install node modules for both the back end and front end. 
type in npm start on both front and server side once installed 

Mongoose is connect with a URI and hidden in a .env folder in order to change the database insert your own unique URI in place of what already exists in the .env folder.
